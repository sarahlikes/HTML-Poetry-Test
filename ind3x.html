	<p>Pringles and dried apricots, fried chicken and coconut ice cream (vegan), autocratic brisket that belittles smoshed potatoes. The remnants of my strawberry cheesecake cone infused with 300 mg of weed, probably now still about 250 mg left after the few bites I have taken. Mirepoix on or in anything-- soup of chicken noodle or alongside barbeque braised beans! Pretzels mingled with lays chips, and separately barbeque chips with frozen grapes. Hot chocolate with a side of jumbo marshmallows and, if im honest? Roast them over the stovetop fire on a fork before your parents get home from work. For nutrition, we should take a banana. </p>

	<p>Also, we should stop at McDonalds for a happy meal obviously chicken nuggets and french fries a mcflurry… I won’t be able to finish it after the hot chocolate. We will need another location to drive to! So that I may finish it, it’s a terrible habit to waste food. Fuck it, cheese balls. Whipped cream cloud beckoning blueberries to tuft its foamy links. Pistachio infused croissants, obviously. Lemon meringue and fried broccoli. Prunes and coffee and cigarettes in front of my eyes that put out the moon. Hearts, I want to eat chicken hearts seared on a kabob and top it off with chef’s’, yes. </p>
